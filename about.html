            <p class="about-padding">
              After graduating from MassArt with a BFA in Graphic Design, I've spent the past 9 years immersed in the dynamic world of design in Boston. Throughout my journey as a Principal Product Designer at Motional, I've not only embraced the creative aspects of my role but also prioritized meticulous organization, process improvements, and comprehensive documentation. My dedication to keeping projects well-organized and thoroughly documented has been instrumental in ensuring smooth workflows and successful outcomes. Additionally, I've had the opportunity to further expand my leadership skills by taking on the role of manager, guiding and mentoring other designers to achieve their full potential.
              <br>
              <br>
              At Motional, I focus on shaping the future of autonomous vehicles, building upon my previous experiences at Accenture Digital Products where I specialized in crafting clean, meaningful, and accessible products for diverse clients across industries such as Finance, Insurance, Consumer Electronics, and more.
              <br>
              <br>
              Beyond my professional endeavors, I was deeply engaged in the design community, taking on roles that allowed me to connect with fellow designers and mentor emerging talents. This included co-organizing Practice Makes, a bi-monthly design meetup in Boston, and guiding UX Design apprentice classes at Accenture's Intrepid studio. Additionally, within my current workplace, I have been an active member of the social committee at Motional, contributing to the establishment of a vibrant community post-COVID through organizing company events and hosting monthly board game nights.
              <br>
              <br>
              Away from my desk, I'm constantly seeking new avenues for growth and expression. Recently, I completed a <a class='certificate' href="images/certificates/eCornell_certificate_JP.png">leadership essentials certificate</a> with Cornell University and am now delving into 3D modeling with Blender to enhance my design capabilities. When the weather permits, you'll often find me on wheels – whether it's biking, skating, or riding my motorcycle. I also enjoy hosting craft nights, playing board and video games, watching thrillers, listening to audio books, painting, gardening, photography, and cooking new plant-based recipes.
              <br>
              <br>
              If you're interested in collaboration or simply want to connect, don't hesitate to reach out – I'm always eager to engage with like-minded individuals.
