            <p class="about-padding">
              Since graduating from MassArt with a BFA in Graphic Design, I've been working in Boston as a Principal Product Designer doing what I love
              for 9 years. I'm considered a full stack designer
              &ndash; which covers a range of skills from project planning and design roadmapping, user research, flows, wireframing, prototyping, complex component structures,
              design system creation, development support, mentoring, and front end development.
              My ideal design process takes a holistic approach.
              <br>
              <br>
              Today you can find me at Motional delivering the future of autnomous vehicles. Previously, I worked at Accenture Digital Products
              consulting across various client projects and crafting clean, meaningful and accessible products.
              I've worked in industries spanning Finance,
              Insurance, Consumer Electronics, Consumer Goods,
              Education, E-Commerce, Small Businesses, Public Sector, Healthcare, Aerospace Engineering and most recently Autonomous Vehicles.
              <br>
              <br>
              Within the design community and as a mentor, I've taken on roles outside of my day to day to connect with other designers in meaningful ways.
              This has included helping run Practice Makes &ndash; a bi-monthly design meetup for the Boston community,
              and mentoring our UX Design apprentice classes within Accenture's Intrepid studio. At my current company, I joined the social committee and have helped
              establish a community at work post COVID with company events and I host our monthly board game nights.
              <br>
              <br>
              Outside of my career, I keep myself busy learning new skills and am always getting into a new activities. I recently completed a <a class='certificate' href="images/certificates/eCornell_certificate_JP.png">leadership essentials certificate</a> with Cornell University, and
              am now learning 3D modeling (C4D & Blender) to aid my current current design role.
              On nice days you'll most likely find me on wheels &ndash; either my bike, scooter, skates, or motorcycle.
              Hosting craft nights, playing board games, finding the next best thriller, painting, gardening, and crafting new plant based recipes
              are a few other thing that occupy my time.
              <br>
              <br>
              If you're interested in working together or want to connect and say hello, feel free to reach out!
